        <h2>The Origin of Jhumka Earrings</h2>
        <p>When we think of jhumka, we instantly think of beautiful jewelry that dances as we move. Jhumka is the name given to bell-shaped earrings, reflecting the jingle they make as you turn your head. The word ‘jhumka’ roughly translates to ‘bell’, with most of the earrings we see today reflecting this heritage in their shape.</p>
        <p>You can trace the origins of jhumka earrings back to the ancient temples of the Chola dynasty when it was used in temple statues as early as 300BC. The deities in the temple were adorned with these jewels in tribute and recognition of their status. The jhumka earrings that we know and love today were popularized by Bharatanatyam dancers. The earrings move as fluidly as the dancers who wore them, helping to add to the mystery and allure of their dances. These early jhumka earrings took their inspiration from natural elements while incorporating floral and temple designs.</p>
        
      

        <p>The admiration for jhumka earrings grew across India, with the accessory becoming particularly popular amongst the nobility and royal families. These groups each took the signature bell shape and made it their own by incorporating different design elements, like gemstones and jewels.</p>
        
 

        <p>As the nobility – particularly women – were adorned with heavy jewelry for everyday wear, jhumka earrings had an innovative design. These earrings have a hollow interior, making them lightweight to wear without losing the dramatic impact of the style. As a result, jhumka earrings became the preference for generations of women.</p>
        
     

        <p>The Mughal Empire took the earring to the next level, often adding a ‘sankali’, an ornamental chain that connected a ‘kanphool’ – a statement stud - to the hair with a small hook. It was added onto the jhumka earring, which usually had long pearl tassels with diamonds and a gold setting. Over time, the dome of the kanphool stud evolved to create the distinctive shape we find today in high-end earrings. Now a single, oversized earring, the jhumka remains one of the most coveted jewels for any woman’s jewelry box. It’s popular across Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India – as well as breaking into Western fashion.</p>
